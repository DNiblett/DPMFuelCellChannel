# DPMFuelCellChannel
Mechanistic Discrete Particle Model (DPM) used to estimate the two-phase flow regimes in straight fuel cell channels.
Used to estimate how the properties of the interface between the gas channel and the gas diffusion layer in terms of wettability and flow rates influences the amount of water covering the GDL surface and the saturation of the channels.
To run you need to download the additional files for vtk writing and surface visualisation.
Commented code is there for potential work in progress and so some sections may not work.
This code was used to generate the results in the publication: Niblett, Daniel, Stuart Martin Holmes, and Vahid Niasar. "Discrete-particle model to optimize operational conditions of proton-exchange membrane fuel-cell gas channels." ACS Applied Energy Materials 4.10 (2021): 10514-10533.
